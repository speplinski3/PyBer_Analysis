# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview & Purpose of Analysis:

Pyber is requesting a new dataframe where ride-sharing is visualized by total fares for each city type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural). The dataframe is vizualized in a 
line chart where fare by city type can be easily discerned and business decisions made based on the new dataframe.

## Results
### Summary of Totals & Averages by City Type

Rural rides had a far smaller number than urban rides, 125 rides for rural customers to 1,625 rides for urban customers. However, 
the average fare per driver for rural areas was much higher at $55.49 than urban areas at $16.57. Rural areas have destinations that are further apart than urban areas,
so this may explain this data. While rural areas have a high fare per driver, urban areas outweigh the other city types in fares by far.
The ratio of drivers to rides in rural areas is 0.624 compared to 0.784 in suburban areas and 1.48 in urban areas. Suburban total fares are $19,356.33
and indicate a similar fare per ride and fare per driver.

According to the visualization, all three city types follow a relatively similar pattern in ride fare and demand, with the exception of a spike in 
suburban fare toward the end of April.

## Summary of Implications and Points of Consideration
* Total rate of fares by city type seem to follow a similar pattern, with the exception of suburban fare around the end of April.
* There is far less overall money made in rural areas and more made in urban areas. The rates per driver are much higher in rural areas compared to urban areas. 
* Compared to suburban areas, urban ride sharing is still the highest used. 
* Urban drivers make the least amount per city type. There are many more drivers in the urban areas.
